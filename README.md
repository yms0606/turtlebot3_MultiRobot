# 🤖 Multi-Robot Control System with TurtleBot3 Simulation

This project demonstrates a multi-robot control system developed using **TurtleBot3 Simulation**. The project includes simultaneous and individual robot control with **Flask-based UI**. The system is designed to provide real-time monitoring and manual control of multiple robots in a shared environment.
<br><br>**동일한 개발 환경 내에서 ROS2를 활용하여 2개 이상의 터틀봇을 동시&개별 제어하는 프로젝트를 구현하였습니다.**
